"A database purge permanently removes the references to deleted documents "
"from the database. Normal deletion of a document within CouchDB does not "
"remove the document from the database, instead, the document is marked as "
"``_deleted=true`` (and a new revision is created). This is to ensure that "
"deleted documents can be replicated to other databases as having been "
"deleted. This also means that you can check the status of a document and "
"identify that the document has been deleted by its absence."

"rely on this API as a way of doing secure deletion."
