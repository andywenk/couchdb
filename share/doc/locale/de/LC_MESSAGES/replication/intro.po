"One of CouchDB's strengths is the ability to synchronize two copies of the "
"same database. This enables users to distribute data across several nodes or"
" datacenters, but also to move data more closely to clients."

"Replication involves a source and a destination database, which can be one "
"the same or on different CouchDB instances. The aim of the replication is "
"that at the end of the process, all active documents on the source database "
"are also in the destination database and all documents that were deleted in "
"the source databases are also deleted on the destination database (if they "
"even existed)."

"A replication is triggered by storing a replication document in the "
"replicator database. Its status can be inspected through the active tasks "
"API (see :ref:`api/server/active_tasks` and :ref:`replication-status`). A "
"replication can be stopped by deleting the document, or by updating it with "
"its `cancel` property set to `true`."

#: ../../src/replication/intro.rst:46
msgid ""
"During replication, CouchDB will compare the source and the destination "
"database to determine which documents differ between the source and the "
"destination database. It does so by following the :ref:`changes` on the "
"source and comparing the documents to the destination. Changes are submitted"
" to the destination in batches where they can introduce conflicts. Documents"
" that already exist on the destination in the same revision are not "
"transferred. As the deletion of documents is represented by a new revision, "
"a document deleted on the source will also be deleted on the target."

"A replication task will finish once it reaches the end of the changes feed. "
"If its `continuous` property is set to true, it will wait for new changes to"
" appear until the task is cancelled. Replication tasks also create "
"checkpoint documents on the destination to ensure that a restarted task can "
"continue from where it stopped, for example after it has crashed."

"When a replication task is initiated on the sending node, it is called "

"One replication task will only transfer changes in one direction. To achieve"
" master-master replication it is possible to set up two replication tasks in"
" different directions. When a change is replication from database A to B by "
"the first task, the second will discover that the new change on B already "
"exists in A and will wait for further changes."

"Additionally, :ref:`filterfun` can be used in a replication documents (see "
":ref:`replication-settings`). The replication task will then evaluate the "
"filter function for each document in the changes feed. The document will "
"only be replicated if the filter returns `true`."
