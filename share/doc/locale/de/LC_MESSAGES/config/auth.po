"A default CouchDB install provides admin-level access to all connecting "
"users. This configuration is known as `Admin Party`, and is not recommended "
"for in-production usage. You can crash the party simply by creating the "
"first admin account. CouchDB server administrators and passwords are not "
"stored in the ``_users`` database, but in the ``local.ini`` file, which "
"should be appropriately secured and readable only by system administrators::"

"Administrators can be added directly to the ``[admins]`` section, and when "
"CouchDB is restarted, the passwords will be salted and encrypted. You may "
"also use the HTTP interface to create administrator accounts; this way, you "
"don't need to restart CouchDB, and there's no need to temporarily store or "
"transmit passwords in plaintext. The HTTP ``_config/admins`` endpoint "
"supports querying, deleting or creating new admin accounts:"
