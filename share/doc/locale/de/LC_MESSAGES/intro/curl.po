"The ``curl`` utility is a command line tool available on Unix, Linux, Mac OS"
" X and Windows and many other platforms. ``curl`` provides easy access to "
"the HTTP protocol (among others) directly from the command-line and is "
"therefore an ideal way of interacting with CouchDB over the HTTP REST API."

"For simple ``GET`` requests you can supply the URL of the request. For "
"example, to get the database information:"

"For some URLs, especially those that include special characters such as "
"ampersand, exclamation mark, or question mark, you should quote the URL you "

"You can explicitly set the HTTP command using the ``-X`` command line "
"option. For example, when creating a database, you set the name of the "
"database in the URL you send using a PUT request:"

"You can also submit 'payload' data, that is, data in the body of the HTTP "
"request using the ``-d`` option. This is useful if you need to submit JSON "
"structures, for example document data, as part of the request. For example, "
"to submit a simple document to the ``demo`` database:"

"The API samples in the :ref:`api/basics` show the HTTP command, URL and any "
"payload information that needs to be submitted (and the expected return "
"value). All of these examples can be reproduced using ``curl`` with the "
"command-line examples shown above."
