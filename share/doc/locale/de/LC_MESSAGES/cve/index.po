"Note that all networked servers are subject to denial of service attacks, "
"and we cannot promise magic workarounds to generic problems (such as a "
"client streaming lots of data to your server, or re-requesting the same URL "
"repeatedly). In general our philosophy is to avoid any attacks which can "
"cause the server to consume resources in a non-linear relationship to the "
"size of inputs."
