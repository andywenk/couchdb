"A specially crafted request could be used to access content directly that "
"would otherwise be protected by inbuilt CouchDB security mechanisms. This "
"request could retrieve in binary form any CouchDB database, including the "
"`_users` or `_replication` databases, or any other file that the user "
"account used to run CouchDB might have read access to on the local "
"filesystem. This exploit is due to a vulnerability in the included MochiWeb "
