"In CouchDB, design documents provide the main interface for building a "
"CouchDB application. The design document defines the views used to extract "
"information from CouchDB through one or more views. Design documents are "
"created within your CouchDB instance in the same way as you create database "
"documents, but the content and definition of the documents is different. "
"Design Documents are named using an ID defined with the design document URL "
"path, and this URL can then be used to access the database contents."
