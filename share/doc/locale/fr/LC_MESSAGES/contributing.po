"The current state includes mostly tables describing the JSON structure "
"(after all, that's the title of this chapter), but some prose about the "
"number representation can't hurt. For future reference, since the topic in "
"the thread includes views and different encoding in views (as opposed to the"
" storage engine), we should remember to make a note in the views "
"documentation as well, but we'll leave this for later."

"Let's try and find the source file that builds the file "

"under `share/doc/src` we find the file `json-structure.rst`. That looks "
"promising. `.rst` stands for ReStructured Text (see http://thomas-"
