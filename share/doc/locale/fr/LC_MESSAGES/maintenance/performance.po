"There is latency overhead making and receiving each request/response. In "

"batch requires more time your client has to spend encoding the items into "

"As of CouchDB 1.1.0, users often report lower write performance of documents"
" compared to older releases. The main reason is that this release ships with"
" the more recent version of the HTTP server library Mochiweb, which by "
"default sets the TCP socket option `SO_NODELAY`_ to false. This means that "
"small data sent to the TCP socket, like the reply to a document write "
"request (or reading a very small document), will not be sent immediately to "
"the network - TCP will buffer it for a while hoping that it will be asked to"
" send more data through the same socket and then send all the data at once "
