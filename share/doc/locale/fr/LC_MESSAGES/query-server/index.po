"The default query server is written in :ref:`JavaScript <query-server/js>`, "
"running via `Mozilla SpiderMonkey`_. You can use other languages by setting "
"a Query server key in the ``language`` property of a design document or the "
"`Content-Type` header of a `temporary view`. Design documents that do not "
"specify a ``language`` property are assumed to be of type `javascript`, as "
"are ad hoc queries that are POSTed to :ref:`_temp_view <api/db/temp_view>` "
"without a `Content-Type` header."
