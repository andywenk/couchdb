Mine is `janl`, so my fork lives at https://github.com/janl/couchdb. In the header, it tells me me my \"GitHub Clone URL\". We need to copy that and start a terminal:"

msgid "First we should determine where we want to document this inside the documentation. We can look through http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/ for inspiration. The `JSON Structure Reference`_ looks like a fine place to write this up."

msgid "The current state includes mostly tables describing the JSON structure (after all, that's the title of this chapter), but some prose about the number representation can't hurt. For future reference, since the topic in the thread includes views and different encoding in views (as opposed to the storage engine), we should remember to make a note in the views documentation as well, but we'll leave this for later."

msgid "Let's try and find the source file that builds the file http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/json-structure.html -- we are in luck, under `share/doc/src` we find the file `json-structure.rst`. That looks promising. `.rst` stands for ReStructured Text (see http://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html for a markup reference), which is an ascii format for writing documents, documentation in this case. Let's have a look and open it."
