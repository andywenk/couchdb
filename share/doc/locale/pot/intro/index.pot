msgid "CouchDB is a database that completely embraces the web. Store your data with JSON documents. Access your documents with your web browser, :ref:`via HTTP <api/basics>`. :ref:`Query <api/doc>`, :ref:`combine <views>`, and :ref:`transform <listfun>` your documents with :ref:`JavaScript <query-server/js>`. CouchDB works well with modern web and mobile apps. You can even serve web apps directly out of CouchDB. And you can distribute your data, or your apps, efficiently using CouchDBâ€™s :ref:`incremental replication <replication/intro>`. CouchDB supports master-master setups with :ref:`automatic conflict <replication/conflicts>` detection."

msgid "CouchDB comes with a suite of features, such as on-the-fly document transformation and real-time :ref:`change notifications <changes>`, that makes :ref:`web app <couchapp>` development a breeze. It even comes with an easy to use :ref:`web administration console <intro/futon>`. You guessed it, served up directly out of CouchDB! We care a lot about `distributed scaling`_. CouchDB is highly available and partition tolerant, but is also :ref:`eventually consistent <intro/consistency>`. And we care *a lot* about your data. CouchDB has a fault-tolerant storage engine that puts the safety of your data first."
