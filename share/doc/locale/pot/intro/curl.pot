msgid "The ``curl`` utility is a command line tool available on Unix, Linux, Mac OS X and Windows and many other platforms. ``curl`` provides easy access to the HTTP protocol (among others) directly from the command-line and is therefore an ideal way of interacting with CouchDB over the HTTP REST API."
